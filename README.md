## Introduction

This project embarks on a journey of exploration and application within the realm of software development, where the subject matter is open-ended, yet guided by a set of prescribed technologies and patterns. The focal points include web services, offering the flexibility of Java or Node.js, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestrating multi-containers. The project further delves into diverse options, encompassing cloud deployment, database choices between SQL and NoSQL, and front-end development with frameworks like Angular, React, VueJS, and even extending to Android.

### Starting Point (10/20):
•	Initiate with a single local service by coding a mini application in the language of your choice.
•	Create a Docker image, constructing a Dockerfile for the application.
•	Publish the Docker image to Docker Hub for accessibility.
•	Implement Kubernetes deployment and service by referencing charroux/kubernetes-minikube.

### Enhancements (12/20 to 16/20):
•	Expand functionality by incorporating a local gateway using charroux/kubernetes-minikube#routing-rule-to-a-service-using-ingress or leverage a service mesh with charroux/servicemesh.
•	Integrate a second service, following the guidelines provided in charroux/CodingWithKubernetes.
•	Explore database options, choosing between MySQL and PostgreSQL, either locally or in the cloud.
Cloud Deployment (Optional):
Consider deploying the project in a cloud infrastructure for an additional layer of complexity
